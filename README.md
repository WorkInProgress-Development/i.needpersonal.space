The hackathon occurred mostly overnight, when I was unable work on the hackathon, so I wasn't able to actually create much. I am submitting the domain name and idea for the 'Best Domain Name from Domain.com.'

As such, I have created the website, and UI design, although I haven't had time for fully working prototype.
